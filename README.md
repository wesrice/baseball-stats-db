# Baseball Stats DB 

The goal of the project is to share the data provided by the [Baseball Databank files](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank) and [Retrosheet.org](http://retrosheet.org) in a format that allows users to easily load the data into a databases.  Currently there are three officially supported databases PostgreSQL, SQLite and MongoDB.  _MySQL isn't 'officially' support, [read this to find out why](cmd/databank-dbloader/README.md#about_mysql), but I do create backups and schema files for it._.  There are schema files and backups for a Baseball Databank only db, a Retrosheet only db plus a combined database named Baseball Stats.

## Schema Files
The schema files live in the  `schemas` directory. With the schema files for all the database will have the folowing naming convention.

`(mysql|postgres|sqlite)_(databank|retrosheet|combined)_schema_<season>.<version>.sql`

Season is the latest season's data that is contained in the Baseball Databank files.   The version number is the numbered
release for the season's data. A new version is released if the Baseball Databank or Retrosheet release an update to their
files.  Releases are typically released on Sundays.

## Backups
The backup files are included in each release.  Since the files can be big, I've removed the backups from the repository. The naming convention is similar to the schema files.  

`(mongodb|mysql|postgres|sqlite)_(databank|retrosheet|combined)_backup_<season>.<version>.tgz`

Season is the latest season's data that is contained in the Baseball Databank files.   The version number is the numbered
release for the season's data. A new version is released if the Baseball Databank or Retrosheet release an update to their
files.  Releases are typically released on Sundays.

## About MySQL

The reason why MySQL isn't officially supported is due to the fact that there are 14 records that aren't in the `pitchingpost` table. The aren't there due to MySQL's decision to not support the `inf` value for infinity.  Having said that there is support in the `dbloader` code for MySQL.  If you choose to use MySQL just remember that you will not have all the data that is present in the CSV files.

I do not want to put some placeholder value in place of the `inf` simply because MySQL doesn't support it when PostgreSQL and SQLite do.  If you can come up with a clever way of handling this for MySQL that isn't a complete hack feel free to pass it along or make a pull request.

## Utilities
I have removed the binaries from the release files, I believe that most people downloading the releases are there for the data.
I will be moving the code and binaries to my [sports-stats-utilities](https://github.com/rippinrobr/sports-stats-utilities).

## Building with Docker Compose
1. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
1. Run `docker-compose up --build -d`. This will create a Docker container, download all dependencies and compile the binaries. 
1. Enter the container by running `docker-compose run app`.
